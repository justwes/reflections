When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* If I am working in a temp environment/computer and have no need to keep local copies. Or perhaps I am just updating some spelling errors etc... on the Readme.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* There may be an unexpected conflict with the remote changes. Or the changes remotely you may not want to have merged into your local master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

* Forks: take a project and split it off the main branch to continue development in a different direction.

* Clones: make a copy of an existing project.

* Branches: split off from the main branch to test out features or bug fixes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

* The last known state has the history of all previous commits and changes made before. When you make commits you will have an easier time of merging back into the master branch later.
