What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* Creates a .git file that contains the history of changes and the Git struct (I think)

* Need to tell Git that this is a folder/project/directory that will contain stuff that needs to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

* The staging area is a temporary place for changes/files before they are pushed anywhere else.

* By moving files here you can review what changes you will push and make changes to as you need before making a commit.
