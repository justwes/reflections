What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* Creates a .git file that contains the history of changes and the Git struct (I think)

* Need to tell Git that this is a folder/project/directory that will contain stuff that needs to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

* The staging area is a temporary place for changes/files before they are pushed anywhere else.

* By moving files here you can review what changes you will push and make changes to as you need before making a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

* When you run git status to check the staging area it shows what is there and you can remove files prior to adding them and making your commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

* Branches are good for trying out new features or making changes that break the original project in some way.

* Branches help by keeping the changes separate without having to manage separate file bases.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

* Seeing how branches, and changes, relate to each other provides an easier way to understand how branches work.
